### Tree-Style Timeline Implementation Guide

To implement the timeline line with indicators on each item, use a vertical border on the container and an absolute positioned circle on each timeline element:

#### HTML / Tailwind Implementation:
```html
<!-- Experience Container -->
<div class="mt-6 border-l-2 border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-800 pl-6 flex flex-col gap-10">
  
  <!-- Experience Item -->
  <div class="relative">
    <!-- Timeline Dot -->
    <span class="absolute -left-[33px] top-2 h-4 w-4 rounded-full bg-red-600 border-2 border-white dark:border-gray-950"></span>
    
    <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:items-center gap-2">

## 4. GitHub Projects Integration & API

### API Fetch Logic

To list your live projects, execute a client-side or build-time query to the GitHub repository API. Use the code snippet below to fetch, fallback, and render the projects dynamically:

```typescript
const username = 'PramudithaN';
let repos = [];

try {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated`);
  if (res.ok) {
    const rawRepos = await res.json();
    repos = Array.isArray(rawRepos) ? rawRepos.slice(0, 4) : [];
  } else {
    throw new Error('API request failed');
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Fallback to static values if GitHub API rate limit is exceeded
  repos = [
    {
      name: "FraudVista-Frontend",
      html_url: "https://github.com/PramudithaN/FraudVista-Frontend.git",
      description: "A Final Year Project | Frontend Application done using React Typescript-Antd | Fraud Detection System",
      stargazers_count: 0,
      forks_count: 0,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      language: "TypeScript",
      topics: ["Academic"],
    },
    {
      name: "dev-portfolio",
      html_url: "https://github.com/PramudithaN/dev-portfolio.git",
      description: "Portfolio website built with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript",
      stargazers_count: 5,
      forks_count: 1,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      language: "Astro",
      topics: ["portfolio"],
    },
    {
      name: "Algorithm_CW_SlidingPuzzle",
      html_url: "https://github.com/PramudithaN/Algorithm_CW_SlidingPuzzle.git",
      description: "Finding the Start, End nodes and the shortest path of a maze Using A* algorithm-Coursework IIT",
      stargazers_count: 3,
      forks_count: 2,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      language: "JavaScript",
      topics: ["Academic"],
    },
    {
      name: "Vapi-Clone_FrontEnd",
      html_url: "https://github.com/PramudithaN/Vapi-Clone_FrontEnd.git",
      description: "Chatbot Management UI developed with Html and Css",
      stargazers_count: 2,
      forks_count: 0,
      updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      language: "HTML",
      topics: ["Project"],
    }
  ];
}
```

### Language Badge Tailwind Color Mapping

Use a record mapping programming languages to specific colored Tailwind classes:

```typescript
const languageColors: Record<string, string> = {
  JavaScript: 'bg-yellow-900/40 text-yellow-200',
  TypeScript: 'bg-blue-900/40 text-blue-200',
  Python: 'bg-blue-900/40 text-blue-200',
  Java: 'bg-orange-900/40 text-orange-200',
  HTML: 'bg-orange-900/40 text-orange-200',
  CSS: 'bg-indigo-900/40 text-indigo-200',
  Shell: 'bg-green-900/40 text-green-200',
  C: 'bg-gray-900/40 text-gray-200',
  'C++': 'bg-pink-900/40 text-pink-200',
  PHP: 'bg-indigo-900/40 text-indigo-200',
  Ruby: 'bg-red-900/40 text-red-200',
  Go: 'bg-cyan-900/40 text-cyan-200',
  Rust: 'bg-orange-900/40 text-orange-200',
  Dart: 'bg-teal-900/40 text-teal-200',
  Swift: 'bg-orange-900/40 text-orange-200',
  Kotlin: 'bg-purple-900/40 text-purple-200',
};
```

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

interface TestimonialProps {
  name: string;
  role: string;
  avatarUrl: string;
  text: string;
}

export const TestimonialCard: React.FC<TestimonialProps> = ({ name, role, avatarUrl, text }) => {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="bg-card border border-border rounded-xl p-6 shadow-lg flex flex-col justify-between">
